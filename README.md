# Angular2 + Babel + Lazy loading

```
npm install
```

Then just serve it via a static webserver. I am using node-static on MacOS X:

```
npm install -g node-static
static .
open http://localhost:8080/
```

## TODO

Tests
Creating a build
Fixing the system.js mess

## Alternatives

https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed - Very complete (tests etc) but Typescript ;)
https://github.com/shuhei/babel-angular2-app - Would have used that but found it too late ;) No lazy loading though :|
